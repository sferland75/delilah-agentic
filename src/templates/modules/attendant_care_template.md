# ASSESSMENT OF ATTENDANT CARE NEEDS

The following is an Assessment of Attendant Care Needs based on reports of the client and direct observations as of [DATE]. The Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists report "Considerations for Occupational Therapists Completing an Assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1)" was consulted for the completion of the assessment. As per the OSOT Guidelines, "this assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1) is not simply the recording of what attendant care services are already in place. This therapist's role is to determine the extent to which the client can perform the skills and activities identified in the Form 1 safely, functionally, and to objectively identify what assistance, if any, is needed from the present time into the future until another such re-assessment may identify modified needs."
