# Next Development Phase: ADL Section Restoration

## Context
We're working on the Delilah medico-legal report generation system. We've just completed the environmental assessment section with full data integration and visualization. The next phase involves restoring and enhancing the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) section.

## Current Status
- All previous sections (personal, medical, functional, ROM/MMT, environmental) are working
- Form context system is fully functional
- Mock data structure is well-established
- Component architecture is standardized

## Repository Location
- Main repository: d:\delilah
- ADL components expected in: src/components/ADLSection

## Immediate Tasks

1. Component Recovery
   - Locate existing ADL components in the codebase
   - Review their structure and functionality
   - Identify any missing features

2. Data Structure
   - Define comprehensive ADL assessment structure
   - Include activity categories
   - Add independence levels
   - Include assistance requirements
   - Track modifications/adaptations

3. Integration Requirements
   - Ensure proper form context integration
   - Match data structure with form fields
   - Maintain consistency with other sections
   - Add necessary validation

4. Mock Data Updates
   - Enhance ADL section in mock data
   - Include realistic assessment scenarios
   - Add comprehensive activity details
   - Match field structure exactly

## Key Components to Review/Create
1. ADL Overview
2. Activity Assessment
3. Independence Evaluation
4. Modification Tracking
5. Assistance Requirements

## Technical Considerations
- Follow existing form context pattern
- Match component structure of other sections
- Use shadcn/ui components
- Maintain consistent styling
- Update types as needed

## Future Enhancements
1. Visual activity tracking
2. Progress indicators
3. Comparative analysis
4. Historical tracking

## Documentation Needs
1. Component documentation
2. Data structure documentation
3. Integration notes
4. Usage examples

## Resources
- Existing components in src/components
- Form context implementation
- Environmental section as reference
- Mock data structure

## Getting Started
1. Review this document
2. Locate existing ADL components
3. Create component plan
4. Update mock data
5. Implement step by step
