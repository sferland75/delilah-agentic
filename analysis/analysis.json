He remains vocationally engaged, against medical advice, working as a  National Property Manager with Natural Resources Canada, administering $750 million dollars of  government property. By all accounts, Mr. Al Naqeeb appears at this time to not be performing  his duties effectively and struggling to get through a workday. He is currently working from home  and has been found to be a deshevelled state on the day of this assessment. He noted that he rarely  showers (often only every 10 to 14 days), brushes his teeth once every two weeks and will wear  the same clothes and socks for 4 – 5 days. He notes that his mental health has been poor and that  his contribution to the operation of his home is minimal. This has led to significant struggles in  his marriage leading to a separation in or around 2019. Mr. Al Naqeeb is currently back in the  family home noting that he and his wife are attempting to reconcile their marriage.

        "Since the last Assessment of Attendant Care Needs performed on July 20, 2018, there has been no substantive change in the level of care required by Ms. Balduzzi with the exception of an assessed need for 24-hour care as opposed to 8-hour care previously assessed due to her inability to exit her home in case of an emergency at all times.  In this therapist’s opinion, Ms. Balduzzi’s level of deconditioning due to her limited activity levels has resulted in a deterioration of her mobility.  She is not, in this therapist’s opinion, able to exit her home in case of an emergency at any time of day.  While previously found to be self-sufficient during waking hours, this therapist believes that she is now completely dependent on care to safely exit her home in case of an emergency such as a fire.  All other aspects of care remain the same."
