SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
===================
Patrick Anderson sustained multiple severe injuries in a motorcycle accident on
April 28, 2023.

Prior to the accident, he maintained an active lifestyle managing an 18-acre
property, worked in a demanding supervisory role at nuclear facilities, and
regularly engaged in various outdoor recreational activities.

The comprehensive assessment of his current functioning reveals significant
changes across all aspects of daily living, affecting his independence, family
roles, and quality of life.

His activities of daily living have been profoundly impacted by physical
limitations and pain. Basic self-care tasks that were previously routine now
present significant challenges, requiring assistance or modification.

Sleep disruption has become a significant concern, with Mr. Anderson achieving
only 4 hours of sleep per night despite medication. This chronic sleep deficit,
combined with daily pain and fatigue, necessitates daytime rest periods and
affects his overall functioning and energy levels.
