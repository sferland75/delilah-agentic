# Delilah Agentic Testing Strategy

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Delilah Agentic project, covering various testing aspects from unit tests to performance benchmarks.

## Testing Components

### 1. Data Generation
- `data_generator.py`: Creates realistic mock data for testing
- Supports generating assessment, documentation, analysis, and report data

### 2. Data Validation
- `data_validation_framework.py`: Validates data integrity and structure
- Checks input schemas, state transitions, and data quality

### 3. Error Handling
- `error_handling_system.py`: Manages and logs system errors
- Provides error categorization and recovery mechanisms

### 4. Integration Tests
- `integration_tests.py`: Validates interactions between system components
- Ensures smooth data flow and component interoperability

### 5. Performance Benchmarking
- `performance_benchmarks.py`: Measures system performance
- Tracks execution time, memory usage, and resource allocation

### 6. Monitoring
- `monitoring_system.py`: Tracks system health and metrics
- Provides comprehensive system status reporting

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Poetry for dependency management

### Installation
```bash
poetry install
```

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest tests/

# Run specific test module
poetry run pytest tests/integration_tests.py

# Performance benchmarks
poetry run python tests/performance_benchmarks.py
```

## Test Coverage
- Aims for 90%+ code coverage
- Comprehensive validation of all system components
- Extensive error handling and recovery testing

## Performance Benchmarks
- Measures execution time
- Tracks memory usage
- Identifies performance bottlenecks

## Best Practices
- Write modular, focused tests
- Provide clear error messages
- Document test cases thoroughly
- Update tests with new feature implementations

## Continuous Integration
Automated testing via GitHub Actions:
- Multiple Python version testing
- Code quality checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
