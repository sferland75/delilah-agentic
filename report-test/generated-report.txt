Injury/Accident History:

On January 10, 2024, the patient sustained injuries due to a workplace accident where they fell approximately 8 feet from a ladder. The circumstances of the injury involved the patient falling while at work, resulting in trauma to the lower back and left knee, with the primary impact to the lower back and a secondary injury to the left knee upon landing.

Initial symptoms reported included sharp, constant pain in the lower back region rated 7/10 in severity, exacerbated by prolonged sitting, bending, and lifting activities, with intermittent radiation of pain down the left leg. Symptoms were temporarily relieved by rest, ice application, and pain medication. Concomitantly, the patient experienced a dull ache with occasional sharp pain in the left knee, rated 5/10 in severity, aggravated by weight-bearing activities such as walking, stair negotiation, and transitioning from seated to standing positions. Knee symptoms were alleviated by rest, elevation, and ice application, with swelling reported by the end of the day.

Imaging studies were conducted, including an X-ray of the lumbar spine on January 10, 2024, which revealed no acute fracture but mild degenerative changes at the L4-L5 level. Furthermore, an MRI of the left knee on January 15, 2024, identified a grade 2 medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain without associated meniscal tear.

The patient is currently receiving physiotherapy twice weekly, pain management, occupational therapy, and chiropractic care to address their injuries and associated symptoms. Medication regimen includes Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain and inflammation management, and Cyclobenzaprine 10mg at bedtime to alleviate muscle spasms.

Functional Status:

Physical Tolerances:
- Standing tolerance limited to 15 minutes at a time with a pain level of 7/10. Increased pain is reported with prolonged standing, favoring the right leg. Adaptations include regular position changes, use of an anti-fatigue mat, and the ability to lean on counters or supports.
- Walking tolerance limited to 10 continuous minutes with a pain level of 6/10. An antalgic gait pattern is present with reduced weight-bearing on the left leg. Adaptations include the use of a walking stick for longer distances and frequent rest breaks.
- Sitting tolerance limited to 30 continuous minutes with a pain level of 6/10. Frequent position changes are required. Adaptations include the use of an ergonomic chair with lumbar support and regular standing breaks.

Range of Motion (ROM):
- Trunk flexion: 1/2 (limited range with pain throughout)
- Trunk extension: 1/4 (severely limited range with pain)
- Left knee flexion: 3/4 (limited by pain)
- Left knee extension: 3/4 (lacks full extension)

Manual Muscle Testing (MMT):
- Trunk flexion: 3/5 (weakness with pain)
- Trunk extension: 3/5 (weakness with pain)
- Left knee flexion: 4/5 (weaker with pain compared to the right side)
- Left knee extension: 3/5 (significantly weaker on the left side with pain)

Functional Limitations and Adaptations:
The patient demonstrates limited physical tolerances for standing, walking, and sitting, which can significantly impact the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Adaptations such as regular position changes, use of assistive devices (anti-fatigue mat, walking stick), ergonomic equipment, and frequent rest breaks are recommended to manage pain levels and enhance functional independence.

The reduced trunk and knee range of motion, along with decreased strength, can further impair functional mobility, transfers, and activities requiring trunk and lower extremity control. Compensatory strategies and energy conservation techniques may be necessary to optimize participation in desired activities.

Impact on Daily Activities:
The physical limitations and adaptations described above may affect the patient's ability to perform various daily activities, such as household chores, community mobility, self-care tasks, and vocational or recreational pursuits. Ongoing monitoring and modifications to the environment, equipment, and task approach may be required to promote safety, independence, and quality of life.

ADL Assessment:

Basic ADLs:

Bathing:
Patient requires moderate assistance with shower transfers and lower body washing due to limited trunk flexion and knee mobility. Assistive devices utilized include a shower chair, grab bars, and a handheld shower head. Bathing is performed on a daily basis and typically takes 15-30 minutes with caregiver assistance. Safety considerations include fall risk during transfers and limited lower extremity range of motion.

Dressing:
Upper Body Dressing: Patient is modified independent with upper body dressing, utilizing a button hook and dressing stick. Prefers front-closure clothing to facilitate independence. No concerns with safety or range of motion for upper extremities.

Lower Body Dressing: Patient requires minimal assistance with lower body dressing, using a sock aid and long-handled shoe horn. Exhibits difficulty with bending and lifting legs, necessitating caregiver assistance with donning socks and shoes. Safety considerations include fall risk during lower body dressing tasks.

Instrumental ADLs:
Data regarding instrumental ADLs was not provided in the given information. Assessment of activities such as meal preparation, medication management, housekeeping, and community mobility could not be comprehensively evaluated without additional details.

Overall, the patient demonstrates varying levels of independence across basic ADLs, with a noted need for moderate to minimal assistance with bathing and lower body dressing tasks. Appropriate assistive devices are currently being utilized to maximize independence and safety. Ongoing monitoring and potential implementation of additional adaptive equipment or environmental modifications may be warranted as functional status changes over time.

Environmental Assessment:

This is a two-story single-family home. Access is a primary concern given the presence of steps at both entrances and an internal staircase to the second floor. 

Exterior:
The front entrance has 3 steps with a railing on the right side. The back entrance has 2 steps without a railing, posing a fall risk. Recommendations include installing a railing at the back entrance and evaluating the need for a ramp to provide step-free access.

Interior: 
The internal staircase has 14 steps with railings on both sides. While this meets current building codes, additional handrails may be beneficial for increased support and safety. A stair lift should be considered for long-term accessibility needs.

Bathroom:
The bathroom layout raises safety concerns. Immediate modifications are recommended, including the installation of grab bars and non-slip surfaces to reduce fall risks. A long-term goal should be a bathroom renovation to create a walk-in shower for improved accessibility.

Kitchen:
The current kitchen setup may not accommodate seated work areas or easy access to appliances like the microwave. Lowering the microwave to an accessible height and exploring options for modifying counter spaces and storage are recommended for improved functionality.

Other Areas of Concern:
Potential trip hazards from throw rugs should be addressed by removing or securing them with non-slip backings. Bed rails may also be beneficial for safe transfers and preventing falls from the bed.

This home would benefit from a multi-phase modification plan to gradually improve safety and accessibility. Short-term priorities include bathroom adaptations, followed by long-term projects like a stair lift and kitchen renovations. Appropriate assistive equipment and home modifications can enhance independence and promote aging in place.
