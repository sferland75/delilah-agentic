# Welcome to Delilah: OT Assessment & Report Generation System

## Current Status
As of January 2025, we have achieved several major milestones:
- âœ… Functional web-based assessment form
- âœ… JSON data export capability
- âœ… Agent-based report generation system
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (74 tests passing)
- âœ… Basic clinical narrative generation

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. Run test suite: `npm test`
4. Check test coverage and reports

## Project Overview
Delilah is an integrated occupational therapy assessment and report generation system. We've successfully implemented an agent-based architecture where specialized components (agents) transform assessment data into clinically appropriate report sections.

### Key Features
- Digital OT assessment form (web-based)
- Structured data collection with validation
- JSON export functionality
- Automated report generation
- Clinical narrative synthesis
- Agentic drafting support

## Core Architecture

### Assessment Data â†’ Report Pipeline:
```
Web Form â†’ JSON Assessment Data â†’ Report Agents â†’ Formatted Clinical Report
   â†“              â†“                    â†“
Validation    Data Export         Agent Types
                                - Structured
                                - Light Narrative
                                - Moderate Narrative
                                - Full Narrative
```

## Implementation Status

### What's Working
- âœ… Web-based assessment form
- âœ… Full data validation
- âœ… JSON export functionality
- âœ… Basic report generation
- âœ… Demographics processing
- âœ… Medical history integration
