   - Historical tracking and monitoring
   - Integration with Assessment and Analysis agents

2. Frontend Visualization:
   - New `CrossAgentPatternsDisplay` component
   - Integration with existing metrics display
   - Multiple visualization modes:
     - Relationship graph
     - Pattern evolution
     - Correlation scatter plot

3. API Endpoints:
   - `/api/monitoring/learning/cross-patterns`
   - `/api/monitoring/learning/cross-patterns/history`
   - Comprehensive test coverage

4. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Mock data generation for testing

### Implementation Details

#### Cross-Agent Learning
- Pattern correlation threshold: 0.75
- Success rate weighting: 0.3
- Factor correlation weighting: 0.7
- Pattern tracking includes:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Evolution history
  - Application success rates

#### Visualization Features
- Real-time pattern relationship graph

   - AsyncIO for concurrency

### Configuration

1. Pattern Matching:
   ```python
   correlation_threshold = 0.75
   success_rate_weight = 0.3
   factor_correlation_weight = 0.7
   ```

2. Monitoring:
   ```python
   pattern_history_retention = 30  # days
   min_confidence_threshold = 0.8
   ```

### Restore Instructions

1. Checkout branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/agent-system-dev
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

3. Run tests:
