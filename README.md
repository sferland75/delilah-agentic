   source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configuration Files:
   - `.env` contains database connection string
   - `alembic.ini` configured for migrations

### Current Database Schema

```sql
Table "public.agents"
   Column   |           Type           | Nullable | Default
