# Delilah Report Generation System - Development Guide

## Current Focus (January 2025)
We've achieved stable BaseAgent implementation with high test coverage (84.78%) and are now focusing on narrative generation improvements.

### Recently Completed
- ✅ BaseAgent error handling and test coverage
- ✅ Feature flag system for narrative capabilities
- ✅ Core test utilities and infrastructure
- ✅ Base test suite with 30 passing tests

### Development Priorities

#### 1. Narrative Component Coverage
Current coverage is low (~17%) and needs improvement:
- [ ] NarrativeEngine.ts (26.74%)
- [ ] MedicationAnalyzer.ts (3.27%)
- [ ] SymptomAnalyzer.ts (10.89%)
- [ ] TemporalAnalyzer.ts (31.48%)
- [ ] ADLAnalyzer.ts (15.62%)

#### 2. Narrative Generation Enhancements
- [ ] Improve context building
- [ ] Enhance error recovery
- [ ] Add more sophisticated narrative patterns
- [ ] Implement better temporal analysis

#### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Add narrative-specific test utilities
- [ ] Improve mock data generation
- [ ] Add integration tests for narrative flow
- [ ] Implement narrative validation helpers

## Development Guidelines

### Narrative Component Development
```typescript
// Example narrative component test structure
describe('NarrativeComponent', () => {
    describe('Core Functionality', () => {
        // Basic functionality tests
    });
    
    describe('Error Handling', () => {
        // Error case tests
    });
    
    describe('Integration', () => {
        // Integration with other components
    });
});
```

### Testing Requirements
1. Maintain or exceed current coverage levels
2. Focus on error handling and edge cases
3. Use provided test utilities
4. Follow established patterns

## Resources
- Established test patterns in BaseAgent.test.ts
- Narrative test utilities in testing/narrative/
- Mock data templates in testing/mockData/

## Next Steps
1. Improve NarrativeEngine.ts coverage
2. Enhance analyzer components
3. Add integration tests
4. Document narrative patterns
