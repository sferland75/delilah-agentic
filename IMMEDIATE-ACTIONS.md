# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

## Current Issues - February 10, 2025

### ROM/MMT Assessment Body Map
- Issue: ROM values are being recorded in the findings table but not updating the visual body map
- Data Flow Problem: There's a disconnect between how ROM data is being stored and how it's being read for visualization
- Components Affected:
  - src/components/RomMmtMap/index.tsx
  - src/components/RomMmtMap/utils.ts
  - src/components/BodyMap/joints.ts

### Specific ROM/MMT Issues:
1. Data Storage vs Visualization:
   - ROM data is being successfully stored and displayed in findings table
   - Body map circles not updating colors to reflect ROM values
   - Potential mismatch in data structure between storage and visualization layers

2. Component Integration:
   - ROMAssessment component is correctly capturing and storing data
   - BodyMap component not receiving or interpreting the data correctly
   - Need to align data structure between components

### Priority Actions:
1. Debug Data Flow:
   - Verify data structure in form context
   - Ensure consistent data format between storage and visualization
   - Check data transformation in utils.getJointROMScore

2. Fix Color Mapping:
   - Review color assignment logic in utils.getJointColor
   - Verify CSS class application in BodyMap component
   - Ensure proper state updates trigger re-renders

### Next Steps:
1. Add comprehensive logging to track data flow
2. Review and align data structures between components
3. Test and verify ROM data visualization
4. Document final data structure for future reference

### Known Working Features:
- ROM data entry and storage
- ROM findings table display
- Basic form functionality
- Data persistence
