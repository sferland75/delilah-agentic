# Next Developer Guide

## Current State
The application has a functioning authentication system and basic patient management, with the following key features implemented:

1. Authentication:
   - JWT-based login
   - Protected routes
   - Demo user system

2. Patient Management:
   - Patient listing with search
   - Patient creation/editing
   - Patient details view
   - Basic validation

3. Initial Assessment Framework:
   - Assessment data structures
   - Basic API endpoints
   - Frontend scaffolding

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Complete Assessment Implementation
The most urgent next step is completing the assessment system:

```typescript
// Assessment form structure needed:
interface AssessmentForm {
  patient_id: number;
  scheduled_date: string;
  assessment_type: AssessmentType;
  status: AssessmentStatus;
  notes?: string;
  // Add fields for assessment-specific data
}
```

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement assessment creation form
- [ ] Add assessment workflow states
- [ ] Create assessment detail view
- [ ] Link assessments to patient records

### 2. Form Validation
Add comprehensive validation:
- [ ] Frontend form validation using react-hook-form
- [ ] Backend validation using Pydantic
- [ ] Error message standardization

### 3. Error Handling
Implement robust error handling:
- [ ] Frontend error boundaries
- [ ] API error standardization
- [ ] Error logging system

## Development Patterns

### Frontend Structure
```
features/
├── feature-name/
│   ├── components/     - React components
│   ├── hooks/         - Custom hooks
│   ├── types/         - TypeScript types
│   └── services/      - API services
```

### Backend Structure
```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── routes/        - API endpoints
│   ├── models/        - Database models
│   ├── schemas/       - Pydantic schemas
│   └── services/      - Business logic
```

## Testing Approach
1. Frontend Testing:
   - Component tests with React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for features
   - Mock service calls

2. Backend Testing:
   - API endpoint tests
   - Service unit tests
   - Database integration tests

## Best Practices
1. Use TypeScript strictly
2. Follow React hooks pattern
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Write tests for new features
5. Update documentation
6. Use consistent naming
